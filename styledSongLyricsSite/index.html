        <b>[Verse 1]</b>
        <br>I remember better days
        <br>I'd be like, "Hey, boy, come on right around"
        <br>And you did, and you did, and you did, you always met me there
        <br>We were young, we were dumb, yeah, we had a good run
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
        <br>But now, I'm off that Rie—, I'm off that Riesling
        <br>Out in these streets, deleting what you mean to me
        <br>Then you pop back, back in my mind
        <br>I go back in time
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        <br>It was the perfect night
        <br>Kissin' you
        <br>Was rainin' purple skies
        <br>In my room, me and you
        <br>Ooh, I'm missin' you
        <br>Ooh, I'm—
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Verse 2]</b>
        <br>I miss that feelin' you would bring
        <br>I miss the way that you would make my sidekick bling and bling
        <br>I look at my fingers and think about rings
        <br>Yeah, we had a good thing
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Pre-Chorus]</b>
        <br>But now, I'm off that Rie—, I'm off that Riesling
        <br>Out in these streets, deleting what you mean to me
        <br>Then you pop back, back in my mind
        <br>I go back in time
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        <br>It was the perfect night
        <br>Kissin' you
        <br>Was rainin' purple skies
        <br>In my room, me and you
        <br>Ooh, I'm missin' you
        <br>Ooh, I'm—
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Bridge]</b>
        <br>Let's go back to, back to
        <br>Let's go back to, doo-doo-doo
        <br>Let's go back to, back to
        <br>Ooh, I'm—
        <br>Let's go back to, back to
        <br>Let's go back to, doo-doo-doo
        <br>Let's go back to, back to
        <br>Ooh, I'm—
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Breakdown]</b>
        <br>It was the perfect night, ooh, yeah
        <br>Oh, oh, oh
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        <br>It was the perfect night (The night)
        <br>Kissin' you (Oh, I'm missin' you)
        <br>Was rainin' purple skies
        <br>In my room, me and you (Let's go back to, back to)
        <br>Ooh, I'm missin' you (Ah, yeah; Let's go back to, back to)
        <br>Ooh, I'm—
