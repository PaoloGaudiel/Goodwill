[Verse 1]
I remember better days
I'd be like, "Hey, boy, come on right around"
And you did, and you did, and you did, you always met me there
We were young, we were dumb, yeah, we had a good run

[Pre-Chorus]
But now, I'm off that Rie—, I'm off that Riesling
Out in these streets, deleting what you mean to me
Then you pop back, back in my mind
I go back in time

[Chorus]
It was the perfect night
Kissin' you
Was rainin' purple skies
In my room, me and you
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Ooh, I'm—

[Verse 2]
I miss that feelin' you would bring
I miss the way that you would make my sidekick bling and bling
I look at my fingers and think about rings
Yeah, we had a good thing

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'm off that Rie—, I'm off that Riesling
Out in these streets, deleting what you mean to me
Then you pop back, back in my mind
I go back in time

[Chorus]
It was the perfect night
Kissin' you
Was rainin' purple skies
In my room, me and you, baby
Ooh, I'm missin' you
Ooh, I'm missin' you

[Bridge]
Let's go back to, back to
Let's go back to, doo-doo-doo
Let's go back to, back to
Ooh, I'm—
Let's go back to, back to
Let's go back to, doo-doo-doo
Let's go back to, back to
Ooh, I'm—

[Breakdown]
It was the perfect night, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
It was the perfect night (The night)
Kissin' you (Oh, I'm missin' you)
Was rainin' purple skies
In my room, me and you (Let's go back to, back to)
Ooh, I'm missin' you (Ah, yeah; Let's go back to, back to)
Ooh, I'm—

[Outro]
I'm missin' you
